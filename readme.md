# Braidjs: Synchronization in Javascript

This contains a reference implementation in Javascript of the
[Braid protocol](https://github.com/braid-work/ietf-braid-draft), which adds
*synchronization* to HTTP.

This implementation is not yet complete, but aims to be fully-functioning and
robust enough for production sites.
